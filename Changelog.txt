		- network setting now has new option for monitoring all interfaces (aimed at non UNRAID users)
		- add in logic changes for main script and comments in settings file

    - v.3.8.1
        - Adjusted thread timing calculations
        - Rearranged when settings check occurs during initialization
        - init.sh files now check if the script exists in the same directory
        - various text output changes
        - fix git breaking line endings for init.sh files (thanks git)

    - v.3.7.2 (2024-06-15)
        - minor text output tweaks
        - NEW: get stats/info of the current process

        - init.sh will skip dependency check if it hasn't been over a month (saves CPU on startup)
        - refactored CPU temp sensor check routine (less spaghetti; the solution was revealed to me while on the toilet)
        - more settings checks and small refactoring
    - v.3.7.1 (2024-06-03)
        - Code is mature and has diverged enough (v.3.7) that all active VSCode references are now removed (no more VSCode debug)
    - This script can now run on other systems that aren't UNRAID, sorta. All thanks to the following init.sh changes:
        - NEW: "portable" version of init.sh that sets up a virtual python environment if run outside of Docker    
        - no more hard-coded locations; init.sh will execute main.py if it's in the same directory
        - environment variables now baked into init.d
        - init.sh now checks for internet when doing setup or package checks and handles no connections accordingly
        - init.sh has proper exit codes now (Docker used to report an exit code 143 when asked to shutdown)
        - NEW: time how long it takes to set things up before actually running python
        - some type hint regressions to run on older python versions
    - Significantly revised and refactored thread timeouts (again)
        - NEW: option to display full render time like how it used to be in v.3.5
        - plot_profiler() will now monitor both threads and allow us to set time outs respectively
        - NEW: more granular stats
        - complicated things with numpy arrays and lists
        - NEW: if threads time out enough times, bumps up baseline values until they don't (up to 4 instances)
        - worker thread time outs no longer kill this script (finally)
        - tighter post-profiled timeouts and clarifed output messages
        - reduced loop pause down to just refresh rate (was refresh rate * 2)
    - NEW: automatically set minimum refresh rate if the system is really slow (determined by setup time)
    - NEW: settings checker will now list available sensors and NIC interfaces if it fails to find any
    - more resiliency against broken python environments and revised error outputs
    - Docker no longer needs environment variables as they're handled both in here and in the init.sh script
    - additional CPU temp fallbacks
    - move external dependency imports to later in the script for better debug in different environments
    - more accurate physical memory usage calculation
    - bigger default font size and legibility improvements for text overlays on plots
